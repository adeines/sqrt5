TODO LIST

[ ] (everybody) Figure out problems with isogeny code, then draw an
    isogeny graph

[ ] (william or Jon) write an abstract

[ ] (william) fill in acknowledgement for NSF

[ ] (william) bottom of page 1, "is supported by theoretical evidence"
      (citation needed?) -- can copy something from my NSF proposal

[ ] clean up and update references; grabbing bibtex entries from mathscinet

[ ] (william) write section 2.2.3

[ ] (william) write section 2.2.4

[ ] (william) write section 2.2.5.  Note that there is a theoretical
    obstruction to doing this provably correctly at present!

[ ] (william or ben or ashwath) fill in proposition 3.1: " TODO: Explain how to tell if $\ell\mid \#E(F)_{\tor}$."

[ ] (ben) reference and comments for conjecture 3.2 need to be fixed

[ ] (william) reference for Dembele's "An algorithm for modular elliptic curves..." in 3.6

[ ] (anybody) clean up the table's section a bit (probably just want
    to write a few sentences at the beginning that say something like
    "we list a bunch of tables with..."

[ ] (anybody) do something about table 6.5 (CM curves), because it is
    too wide; e.g., put the j-invariants in a different table or the
    text, since there are only 2 of them, and they are repeated a
    bunch.  Then use extra space to give the *actual* conductor (not
    just the norm).

[ ] (william) delete section 6.3

[ ] (william) add a remark to residue rings section explaining why our
    choice of representation is adapted to this problem.

[ ] (william) fix notation in residue ring section to not conflict. 

[ ] (mainly ashwath) table of all curves with nontrivial conjectural sha.
    as corollary -- BSD appears to be true for these curves. we mostly
    checked the full conjecture, right, using the L-function to compute
    the order of sha? (By "we", I mean "someone", but not me.)

[ ] (aly) include more tables, with information up to rank 2

[ ] things to have tables of (or information about):

    - # of curves with each torsion group (mostly done for 199); but
      redo for each torsion structure (not order), e.g., write as 
          1, 2, 3, 4, 2x2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2x4, 9, etc. 
    - # of curves with each rank (may not need to be a separate table,
        since it is not much information (done for 199)
    - # of isogeny classes of each size (done for 199)
 
    (everybody) Other interesting statistics?

    - maybe a table with the number of isogeny/isomorphism
      classes of curves with norm conductor <= N * 100, for N = 1 .. 18,
      or something like that

    - information about the distribution of a_p for a few small p, i.e.,
      for the curves in our data set, here is how many have a_2 = -2,
      -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.
