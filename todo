- Figure out problems with isogeny code, draw an isogeny graph 

- write an abstract
- fill in acknowledgement for NFS
- bottom of page 1, "is supported by theorectical evidence" (citation needed?)
- clean up references a bit (maybe by grabbing bibtex entries from mathscinet)
- sections 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.5...
- fill in proposition 3.1
- reference for Dembele's "An algorithm for modular elliptic curves..." in 3.6
- reference and comments for conjecture 3.2 need to be fixed
- clean up the table's section a bit (probably just want to write a few
    sentences at the beginning that say something like "we list a bunch of
    tables with..."
- maybe do something about table 6.5 (CM curves), because it is too wide, and
    it will get even wider if we change a to \varphi, which we should do
- section 6.3?
- include more tables, with information up to rank 2
- mention somewhat that BSD appears to be true for these curves. we mostly
    checked the full conjecture, right, using the L-function to compute
    the order of sha? (By "we", I mean "someone", but not me.)

things to have tables of (or information about):
    - # of curves with each torsion group (mostly done for 199)
    - # of curves with each rank (may not need to be a separate table,
        since it is not much information (done for 199)
    - # of isogeny classes of each size (done for 199)
    - a list of curves, or something like that, with nontrivial sha
 
    other interesting statistics?

    - maybe a table with the number of isogeny/isomorphism
        classes of curves with norm conductor <= N * 100, for N = 1 .. 18,
        or something like that

    - information about the distribution of a_p for a few small p
    -
