\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Elliptic Curves over $\Q$}
Tables of elliptic curves over $\Q$ have been of great value in
mathematical research.  The first systematic published tables were in
Antwerp IV \cite{antwerpiv}, which included all elliptic curves over
$\Q$ of conductor up to $200$, and also a table of all elliptic curves
with bad reduction only at $2,3$.

Cremona then wrote a book \cite{cremona:algs} that gave a careful and
detailed description of a suite of algorithms that together would
output a list of all elliptic curves over $\Q$ of any specific given
conductor, along with extensive data about each curve.  The proof that
his algorithm output all curves of given conductor had to wait for
\cite{breuil-conrad-diamond-taylor}.  Cremona has subsequently
computed tables \cite{cremona:onlinetables} of all elliptic curves
over $\Q$ of conductor up to $200,000$, and his main current target is
reaching $234,446$, which is the smallest known conductor of a rank
$4$ curve.
