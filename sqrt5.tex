\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Elliptic Curves over $\Q$}
Tables of elliptic curves over $\Q$ have been of great value in
mathematical research.  Some of the first such tables were those in
Antwerp IV \cite{antwerpiv}, which included all elliptic curves over
$\Q$ of conductor up to $200$, and also a table of all elliptic curves
with bad reduction only at $2$ and $3$.  

Cremona's book \cite{cremona:algs} gives a detailed 
description of algorithms that together output a list of all
elliptic curves over $\Q$ of any given conductor, along with
extensive data about each curve.  The proof that his algorithm output
{\em all} curves of given conductor had to wait for the proof of the
full modularity theorem in \cite{breuil-conrad-diamond-taylor}.  
Cremona has subsequently computed tables \cite{cremona:onlinetables} of all elliptic curves
over $\Q$ of conductor up to $210,\!000$, including Mordell-Weil
groups and other extensive data about each curve; his main current
target is to reach conductor $234,\!446$, which is the smallest known
conductor of a rank $4$ curve.

In a different direction, Stein-Watkins (see \cite{stein-watkins:ants5, bmsw:bulletins}) 
created a table of 136,832,795 elliptic curves over $\Q$ of conductor $\leq 10^8$, and a
table of 11,378,911 elliptic curves over $\Q$ of prime conductor $\leq
10^{10}$. 
% For each curve, these tables contain a numerical
%approximation of $\ord_{s=1} L(E,s)$, and some other data, though the
%actual ranks of every one of these curves has not been determined.
There are also many curves of large discriminant missing from the
Stein-Watkins tables, since these tables are made by enumerating
curves with relatively small defining equations, and discarding those
of large conductor, rather than systematically finding all curves of
given conductor no matter how large the defining equation.

\subsection{Why $\Q(\sqrt{5})$?}

Like $\Q$, the field $F=\Q(\sqrt{5})$ is a totally real field, and
many of the theorems and ideas about elliptic curves over 
$\Q$ have been generalized to totally real fields. As is the case over $\Q$, there is a 
notion of modularity coming from Shimura curve parametrizations and Hilbert modular forms,
 which is supported by theoretical evidence \cite{}.%something suggested by R. Taylor
Moreover,  work \cite{zhang:heightsshimura} of Zhang has extended many results
of Gross-Zagier \cite{gross-zagier} and Kolyvagin \cite{kolyvagin:mordellweil} 
to the context of elliptic curves over totally real fields.

Ordering number fields by the norm of their discriminant,  $F=\Q(\sqrt{5})$ having discriminant $5$ is
the second in order, after $\Q$. That $5$ divides $\disc(F)=5$ thwarts
attempts to easily generalize the method of Taylor-Wiles to elliptic
curves over $F$, makes $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ even more interesting. The
field $F$ also has $31$ CM $j$-invariants, which is far more than any
other quadratic field (see Section~\ref{sec:cm}).  Letting
$\vphi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$, we have that the unit group $\{\pm 1\} \times
\langle \vphi \rangle$ of the ring $R=\cO_F=\Z[\vphi]$ of integers of
$F$ is infinite, leading to additional complications.  Finally,
the $F$ has even degree $2$, which makes certain
computations more difficult, since the cohomological techniques of
\cite{greenberg-voight:shimura} are not applicable.


\subsection{Modularity conjecture}\label{sec:mod}
The following conjecture is open:
\begin{conjecture}[Modularity]\label{conj:mod}
  The set of $L$-functions of elliptic curves over $F$ equals the set
  of $L$-functions associated to cuspidal Hilbert modular newforms
  over $F$ of weight $(2,2)$ with rational Hecke eigenvalues.
\end{conjecture}
Given the huge amount of progress on modularity theorems, we are
optimistic that Conjecture~\ref{conj:mod} will be proved.  {\em We
  thus officially assume Conjecture~\ref{conj:mod} for the rest of
  this paper.}


\section{Computing Hilbert modular forms over $F$}\label{sec:hmf}

We describe Dembele's approach to computing Hilbert modular forms over
$F$, but with additional remarks that fill in missing details in the
algorithm and address how to create a fast implementation.

\subsection{Hilbert modular forms and quaternion 
algebras}\label{sec:dembele}
We recall Dembele's algebraic approach
\cite{dembele:hilbert5} via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence to
Hilbert modular forms of weight $(2,2)$ over $F$.
The Hamiltonian quaternion algebra $F[i,j,k]$ over $F$ is ramified
exactly at the two infinite places, and contains the maximal order
$$
 S = R\left[\frac{1}{2}(1-\overline{\vphi} i + \vphi j),\,
       \frac{1}{2}(-\overline{\vphi} i + j + \vphi k),\,
       \frac{1}{2}(\vphi i - \overline{\vphi} j + k), \,
       \frac{1}{2}(i + \vphi j - \overline{\vphi} k)\right].
$$
For any nonzero ideal $\n$ in $R$, the ring of integers of $F$,
let $\P^1(R/\n)$ be represented by the set of equivalence classes of
 column vectors with two coprime entries $a,b \in R/\n$ modulo the
 action of $(R/\n)^*$. The algebra $F[i,j,k]$ is unramified at all finite primes; in
particular, for each prime $\p\mid \n$, we may fix an isomorphism
$F[i,j,k]\tensor F_{\p} \ncisom M_2(F_{\p})$, which induces a left
action of $S^*$ on $\P^1(R/\n)$. The Jaquet-Langlands correspondence implies that
the space of Hilbert modular forms with level $\n$ and weight $(2,2)$ is
noncanonically isomorphic as a module over the Hecke algebra
$$\T=\Z[T_\p :  \p \text{ nonzero prime ideal of }R]$$ 
to the finite dimensional complex vector space $ V = \C[S^* \backslash
\P^1(R/\n)].  $ The action of $T_{\p}$, for $p\nmid \n$, is
$T_{\p}([x]) = \sum [\alpha x]$, where the sum is over the classes
$[\alpha]\in S/S^*$ with $N_{\text{red}}(\alpha)=\pi_p$ (reduced quaternion norm),
where $\pi_p$ is a totally positive generator of~$\p$.

\subsection{An Algorithm}

In this section we describe an efficient algorithm based on
the isomorphism of Section~\ref{sec:dembele}.

\subsubsection{Computing with $R/\n$}
In order to compute $\P^1(R/\n)$ efficiently, we must be able to
compute with $R/\n$ quickly.  To this end, we factor $\n =
\prod_{i=1}^m \p_i^{e_i}$ and represent elements of $R/\n$ as
$m$-tuples in $\bigoplus R/\p_i^{e_i}$, thus reducing to the prime
power case.  To minimize dynamic memory allocation, thus speeding up the
code by an order of magnitude, we make some bounds on the size of
$\n$; this is not a serious constraint, since the linear algebra
needed to isolate eigenforms for levels beyond this bound is
prohibitive.  We assume $m\leq 16$ and all $p_i^{e_i}\leq 2^{31}$,
where $p_i$ is the residue characteristic of $\p_i$.  In all cases, we represent an
element of $R/\p_i^{e_i}$ as a pair of (signed) 64-bit integers, and
represent an element of $R/\n$ as an array of 16 pairs of 64-bit
integers. We use this representation in all cases, even if $\n$ is
divisible by less than $16$ primes; the gain in speed coming from
avoiding dynamic memory allocation more than compensates for the
wasted memory.

Let $\p^e$ be one of the prime power factors of $\n$, and let $p$ be the residue
characteristic of $\p$. We have one of the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\p$ splits in $R$; then $R/\p\isom \Z/p\Z$ and we represent elements
of $R/\p^e$ as pairs $(a,0)$ mod $p^e$ with the usual addition and multiplication
in the first factor.
\item $\p$ is inert in $R$; then $R/\p^e\isom (\Z/p^e\Z)[x]/(x^2-x-1)$,
and we represent elements by pairs $(a,b) \in \Z/p^e\Z$ with multiplication
$$(a,b)(c,d) = (ac+bd,ad+bd+bc) \mod p^e.$$
\item $\p$ is ramified and $e=2f$ is even; this is exactly the
same as the case when $\p$ is inert but with $e$ replaced by $f$,
since $R/\p^eR \isom (\Z/p^{f}\Z)[x]/(x^2-x-1)$.
\item $\p$ is ramified (so $p=5$) and $e=2f-1$ is odd; the ring $A=R/\p^e$
  is trickier than the rest, because it is {\em not} of the form
  $\Z[x]/(m,g)$ where $m\in\Z$ and $g \in\Z[x]$.  We have $A \ncisom
  (\Z/5^f\Z)[x]/(x^2-5, 5^{f-1}x)$, and represent elements of $A$ as
  pairs $(a,b) \in (\Z/5^f)\times (\Z/5^{f-1}\Z)$, with arithmetic
  given by
\begin{align*}
(a,b) + (c,d) &= (a+c \mod 5^f,\,\,\, b+d \mod 5^{f-1})\\
(a,b)\cdot (c,d) &= (ac+5bd \mod 5^f,\,\,\, ad+bc \mod 5^{f-1}).
\end{align*}
 We find that $ \varphi \in R \mapsto (1/2,1/2)$.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Computing $\P^1(R/\n)$}
We use the bijection $\P^1(\R/\n) \isom \prod_{\p_i^{e_i}}
\P^1(R/\p_i^{e_i})$ to reduce to the prime power case.  Each element
$[(a,b)]$ of $\P^1(R/\p_i^{e_i})$ has a unique representative of the
form $(1,b)$ or $(a,1)$ with $a$ divisible by $\p$, so it is straightforward
to enumerate the elements of $\P^1(R/\p_i^{e_i})$ after choosing a way
to enumerate the elements of $R/\p_i^{e_i}$. We put an element
of $\P^1(R/\n)$ in the above canonical form by working with each factor
individually.

\subsubsection{Enumerating elements of $S$ of norm $\pi_p$ modulo $S^*$}
[[TODO]]
This is around line 1099 of sqrt5.py.  It was pretty tricky to figure out
and involves multiple ideas.

\subsubsection{Enumerating rational newforms}


\section{Strategies for finding an elliptic curve attached to a Hilbert modular form}\label{sec:finding}
In this section we describe various strategies to find an elliptic curve
 associated to each of the Hilbert modular forms computed in Section 2.
Let $f$ be a rational cuspidal Hilbert newform of weight $(2,2)$ as
in Section~\ref{sec:hmf}.  According to Conjecture~\ref{conj:mod},
there is some elliptic curve $E_f$ over $f$ such that $L(f,s) =
L(E_f,s)$.  Note that $E_f$ is only well defined up to isogeny.
Unlike the case for elliptic curves over $\Q$ (see \cite{cremona:algs}), 
there appears to be no {\em efficient} direct algorithm to find $E_f$.
 Nonetheless, there are several approaches coming from various directions, 
which are each efficient in some cases.

Everywhere below, we continue to assume that Conjecture~\ref{conj:mod}
is true and assume that we have computed (as in Section~\ref{sec:hmf})
the Hecke eigenvalues $a_\p\in \Z$ of all rational Hilbert newforms of
some level $\n$, for $\Norm(\p)\leq B$, where $B$ is large enough
distinguish newforms. In some cases we will need far more $a_{\p}$ in 
order to distinguish between elements of our finite set of newforms and 
furthermore, to compute with a sufficient degree of precision, 
the L-function attached to each element.

\subsection{Naive enumeration}\label{sec:naive}

The most naive strategy is to systematically enumerate ordered pairs $(a,b) \in
R^2$ (equivalently, elliptic curves $E:  y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$ over $F$) and for
each curve, to compute $a_\p(E)$ at $\p$ not dividing $\text{Disc}(E)$ by counting points
on $E$ reduced modulo $\p$.  If all the $a_\p(E)$ match with those of the input newform
$f$ up to the bound $B$, we then compute the conductor $\cN_E$, and
if it equals $\n$, we conclude from the sufficient largeness of $B$ that $E$ is in the isogeny class
of $E_f$.

Under our hypotheses, naive enumeration provides an algorithmic
solution to the problem of finding $E_f$: it will terminate, and when
it terminates it outputs a correct curve $E_f$. Unfortunately, it can
be extremely slow because even if $\n$ is small, the simplest curve in the
isogeny class of $E_f$ may have very large coefficients, for example,
if each coefficient is of the form $x+\vphi y$ with $x$ and $y$ having
coefficients around $10^5$, then it would take about $10^{20}$ steps
to find $E_f$, which is not feasible.

\subsection{Torsion families}\label{sec:torsion}

Another method we employ, which makes use of a more directed naive search, is to use parametrizations of families of curves that have specific torsion structures. Sheldon Kamienny and Flilip Najman (\cite{kamienny-najman}) have shown that over $F$, the only torsion structures that appear are the following:

\

$\begin{array}{lll}
\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z},   &1 \leq m \leq 10,& m = 12,\\
\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}/2m\mathbb{Z}, &  1 \leq m \leq 4,&\\
\mathbb{Z}/15\mathbb{Z}.&&
\end{array}$

\

\noindent Over $\mathbb{Q}$, these families have explicit parametrizations (see \cite{kubert:torfam}) that take in either one or two integers and produce a curve with the given torsion structure. Over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})$ though, these parametrizations (which now take elements in $\mathcal{O}_F$) may not be guaranteed to produce all curves with the given structure, and are therefore not a feasible approach for exhaustively finding large numbers of curves up to a certain norm conductor bound. However, this method can be a good place to start if the torsion structure of a target curve is known or guessed. For example, if we know the degrees of $p$-isogenies from an unknown curve $E$ (found using the Hecke eigenvalues of its corresponding newform), we can guess that $E$ may have a $p$-torsion point, which gives a strong indication of its torsion structure. Another advantage to this method is that with relatively small parameters we can find curves with very large coefficients -- curves that a reasonable naive search would miss.

\

\

We can tell whether or not $\ell\mid \#E(F)_{\tor}$ for some
$E$ in the isogeny class of $E_f$ using the following proposition.

\begin{proposition}
 TODO: Explain how to tell if $\ell\mid \#E(F)_{\tor}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Use Galois representations, and also Katz's theorem.
\end{proof}

Instead of searching through all curves as in Section~\ref{sec:naive},
...


\subsection{Twisting}

If $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over a number field $F$, then a \emph{twist} $E'$ of $E$ is a curve isomorphic to $E$ over some extension of $F$. A \emph{quadratic twist} of a curve $E$ is therefore a curve $E'$ isomorphic to $E$ by a map of degree 1 or 2. If we consider $E$ in the form
\begin{equation}
E:   y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c, \nonumber
\end{equation}
then the quadratic twist of $E$ \emph{by} $d$, for any element $d \in K^*$, is given by the equation
\begin{equation}
E^d:   dy^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c, \nonumber
\end{equation}
and the isomorphism from $E$ to $E^d$ is given by the map $\tau_d = [0, a_1(\frac{r-1}{2}), a_3(\frac{r^3-1}{2}), r]$, where r is a root of $r^2 = \frac{1}{d}$ (see \cite{connell:handbook}).

Our implementation of twisting to find new elliptic curves is fairly straightforward: loop through values of $i$ and $j$ up to a certain bound and twist the inputted curve $E$ by $d = i\varphi+j$. This method has similar advantages and disadvantages to the torsion family method; an advantage is that the result of a quadratic twist by $i\varphi+j$ can have vastly different coefficients than the original curve, including much larger values, but a significant disadvantage is that this method is still a naive search of sorts. However, if we are looking for a specific curve with norm conductor $N$, there is an intuitive bound on how high the norm of $d$ should be: the norm conductor of $E_d$ (denote as $||cond(E_d)||$) is divisible by $||d\cdot cond(E)||$. This tells us that if we are looking for curves with norm conductor up to a certain bound, we need not consider twists by elements of very large norm.

\subsection{Curves with specified $a_\p$}

Rather than enumerate through all possible curves, we instead make use
of the known traces of Frobenius to reduce our search space. Suppose
we have a newform $f$ with Hecke eigenvalues $a_\p$, so we know
$\#E_f(R/\p)=\Norm(\p)+1-a_{\p}$. Instead of enumerating over all
curves as in Section~\ref{sec:naive}, we search over lifts to $R$ of the
curves over $R/\p$ that have the given point counts.

We can simultaneously use multiple Hecke eigenvalues
$a_{\p_1},\ldots,a_{\p_k}$ by lifting curves with given point counts
in the $R/\p_i$'s to curves in $R/\prod \p_i$ before lifting to
$R$. This reduces the overall search space, but also rapidly increases
the number of curves to lift.

While this method will eventually terminate just like naive
enumeration, it suffers from the same issue of potentially being very
slow if all curves in the isogeny class have large
coefficients. However, often in practice defined equations for curves
have relatively small coefficients, and because of its simplicity, an
implementation of this algorithm can be quite efficient. 
% Thus this is
%a useful technique when we are building tables of elliptic curves
%associated to newforms and would like to reduce the number of newforms
%that we must run through slower techniques.

\section{Enumerating the curves in an isogeny class}\label{sec:isoclass}

Given an elliptic curve $E/F$, we wish to find representative
isomorphism classes for all elliptic curves $E'/F$ that are isogenous
to $E$ via an isogeny defined over $F$. The analogue of this problem
over $\Q$ has an algorithmic solution as explained in
\cite[\S3.8]{cremona:algs}; it relies on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Mazur's theorem \cite{mazur:rational} 
that if $\varphi:E\to E'$ is a $\Q$-rational isogeny of prime degree, 
then $\deg(\varphi)\leq 163$
\item Formulas of Velu \cite{velu:isogenies} 
that provide a way to explicitly enumerate all $p$-isogenies (if any) with domain $E$.  
Velu's formulas are valid for any number field, but so far there has not been an explicit
generalization of Mazur's theorem for any number field other than $\Q$. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
  Assume the generalized Riemann hypothesis.  Then work of Larson-Vaintrob 
  from \cite{larson-vaintrob} implies that there is an effectively computable constant $C_F$ 
  such that any prime degree isogeny over $F$ has degree at most $C_F$.
\end{remark}

Since we are interested in individual isogeny classes, 
we can use the algorithm described in \cite{billerey:isog} that takes as
input a specific non-CM elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$, and
outputs a provably finite list of primes $p$ such that $E$ might have a
$p$-isogeny. The algorithm is particularly easy to implement in the
case when $K$ is a quadratic field, as explained in
\cite[\S2.3.4]{billerey:isog}.  Using this algorithm combined with
Velu's formulas, we were able to enumerate {\em all}
isomorphism classes of curves isogenous to the curves we found via the
methods of Section~\ref{sec:finding}, and thus divide our curves up into
isogeny classes.


\section{Related future projects}\label{sec:future}

It would be natural to extend the tables to the first known curve of
rank $3$, which may be the known one of norm conductor $163^2=26569$.
It would also be interesting to make a table in the style of
\cite{stein-watkins:ants5}, and compute analytic ranks of the large
number of curves that we would find; this would benefit from
Sutherland's smalljac program, which has very fast code for computing
$L$-series coefficients.  Some aspects of the tables could also be
generalized to modular abelian varieties $A_f$ attached to Hilbert
modular newforms with not-necessarily-rational Hecke eigenvalues; in
particular, we could enumerate the $A_f$ up to some norm conductor,
and numerically compute their analytic ranks.

\section{Tables}\label{sec:tables}

As explained in Sections~\ref{sec:finding} and \ref{sec:isoclass},
assuming Conjecture~\ref{conj:mod}, we found the complete list of
elliptic curves with norm conductor up to $1831$, which is the first
norm conductor of a rank $2$ curve over $F$.  Table~\ref{table:counts}
summarizes the number of curves we found.  Note that in these counts
we do not exclude conjugate curves, i.e., if $\sigma$ denotes the
nontrivial element of $\Gal(F/\Q)$, then we count $E$ and $E^{\sigma}$
separately if they are not isomorphic.  For comparison, 
there are 5260 isogeny classes and 10283 isomorphism classes
of elliptic curves over $\Q$ with conductor up to $1831$ [[double check!]].

[[TODO: This will be a short-as-reasonable table of curves of norm
conductor $\leq 199$, hence including the first curve of rank $1$.  It
will probably be about 6 pages long.]]

\subsection{CM elliptic curves over $F$}\label{sec:cm}

There are $31$ distinct $\Qbar$-isomorphism classes of CM elliptic
curves defined over $F$, more than for any other
quadratic field.

\begin{proposition}
The field $F$ has more isomorphism classes of CM
elliptic curves than any other quadratic field.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Let $K$ be a quadratic extension of $\Q$.
Let $H_D$ denote the Hilbert class polynomial of the CM order
$\O_D$ of discriminant $D$, so $H_D\in \Q[X]$ is the minimal
polynomial of the $j$-invariant $j_D$ of any elliptic curve $E=E_D$ with
CM by $\O_D$.   Since $K$ is Galois, we have $j_D \in K$ if and only if
$H_D$ is either linear or quadratic and has both roots in $K$.
The $D$ for which $H_D$ is linear are the thirteen values
$-3, -4, -7, -8, -11, -12, -16, -19, -27, -28, -43, -67, -163$.
According to \cite{cremona:abvar}, the
$D$ for which $H_D$ is quadratic are the following $29$
discriminants
\begin{align*}
&-15, -20, -24, -32, -35, -36, -40, -48, -51, -52, -60, \\
&-64, -72, -75, -88, -91, -99, -100, -112, -115, -123, \\
&-147, -148, -187, -232, -235, -267, -403, -427
\end{align*}
%z = list(reversed(sorted([D*f^2 for D,f in cm_orders(2)]))); z 
%len(z)
 
By computing discriminants of these Hilbert class polynomials,
we obtain the following table:
% w = {}
% for D, f in cm_orders(2):
%     m = hilbert_class_polynomial(D*f^2).discriminant().squarefree_part()
%     print D, m
%     if not w.has_key(m):
%         w[m] = []
%     w[m].append(D)
%     w[m] = list(reversed(sorted(w[m])))
% print '-'*70
% print w

% for F, Ds in sorted(w.iteritems()):
%     print "\\Q(\\sqrt{%s}) & $%s$ \\\\\\hline"%(F,
%                   ','.join([str(z) for z in Ds]))

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\hline
Field & $D$ so $H_D$ has roots in field\\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{2})$ & $-24,-32,-64,-88$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{3})$ & $-36,-48$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{5})$ & $-15,-20,-35,-40,-60,$ \\
             & $-75,-100,-115,-235$\\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{6})$ & $-72$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{7})$ & $-112$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{13})$ & $-52,-91,-403$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{17})$ & $-51,-187$ \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}\hline
Field & $D$ so $H_D$ has roots in field\\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{21})$ & $-147$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{29})$ & $-232$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{33})$ & $-99$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{37})$ & $-148$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{41})$ & $-123$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{61})$ & $-427$ \\\hline
$\Q(\sqrt{89})$ & $-267$ \\\hline
& \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The claim follows because the $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ row is largest,
containing $9$ entries.  There are thus $31 = 2\cdot 9 + 13$ distinct CM $j$-invariants
in $\Q(\sqrt{5})$.

\end{proof}
